# Visualization-of-Data-

This is the last project of the Udacity Course. It focuses on applying all the codes learned into one, and completeing an analysis in order to interpret the findinds. 

# Introduction

Before the project, I completed 7 lessons that taught me how to write visualization code, properly construct it and modify in order to get a better represantion of the given data. 

# Main Body 

There are multiple recollections to be made with the given visualization. It breaks down into two parts - Exploratory Data and Explanatory Data. In this project we are working with both of them. 

# Univariate Exploration

In this part I have to consider :
- How many variables do I have?
- Do I have missing Data?
- What types of variables do I have? 

After that, I have decided to focus my attention on the Borrower APR (Annual Percentage Rate), while using the variables such as : 
- Loan Status
- Employment Status
- Monthly Income
- Original Loan Amount
- Term 
- Prosper Rating (Alpha)
